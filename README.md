<h2>The following scenario describes how to conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. Evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan:</h2>

A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organization’s security systems. As a cybersecurity analyst, I might help with vulnerability assessments to prevent attacks in an organization. Later, I will add this document to my cybersecurity portfolio, which I can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating my portfolio, read Create a Cybersecurity portfolio. 

Scenario

In this scenario, I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognized that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help communicate the potential risks with decision-makers at the company. Create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
